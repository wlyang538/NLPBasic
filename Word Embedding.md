## Word Embedding

### Prepresentation

Text is unstructure information. And this kind of unstructure data cannot be used by NLP model directly. Representation refers to convert the unstructure information into structure information. 

And then, this kind of structure infromation can be calculated by NLP model, and finally can be used to deal with the nlp task.

There are three methods for Document representation
- One - hot representation
- Integer encoding （整数编码？）
- word embedding
